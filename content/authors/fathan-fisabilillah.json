  "description": "I've worked in the web development industry for over 12 years, primarily building web publishing platforms and integrations for businesses of all sizes. I spent 8 years in the WordPress industry, contributing to the MonsterInsights plugin (3+ million downloaded) and other theme and plugin creations.\n\nI've led large-scale platform redevelopment projects for organizations such as Grab, Standard Chartered, Wuest & Partner AG, OPSI OECD, and the real estate BSD City Government's site.\n\nI'm a software developer at heart, but my approach is always focused on solving user problems first. I favour stable and proven software stacks and advocate for progressive enhancement and accessibility for all.",
