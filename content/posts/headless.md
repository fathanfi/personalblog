Headless Services Experiences with WordPress for an adaptable tech stack
Many advantages come with headless architecture, but making the appropriate partner choice is essential to reaping the full benefits.

### Why become headless?

A headless CMS is an architecture for backend websites that can switch between many front-end frameworks to provide flexible content delivery on various platforms and devices.

The good news is that you don't have to commit "all in" right now. It can construct all of our websites with REST API readiness, so you can easily switch if you ever need more flexibility.

Headless is preferred by organizations because it enables a best-in-class technology stack, enabling creative front-end frameworks and channels to rapidly develop and produce next-generation user experiences.

All of this frees up creative teams to concentrate on user experience and design without interference.
